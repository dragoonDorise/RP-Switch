Pegasus Frontend Theme optimized for the Retroid Pocket 2 Screen. You need to have Pegasus installed in your Retroid Pocket

## Installing Pegasus on the Retroid Pocket 2

Pegasus needs some setup work but is easy as pie if you follow mi [guide for dummies](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/pegasus-rp2-metadata)

## Assets needed
For this theme you need the following media types from [skraper](http://skraper.net):
* screenshot
* wheel

You can also download some pre scraped assets from here: https://bit.ly/2Ie0p21

*Keep in mind these assets may not work with your rom collection. These assets have been scrapped from a collection where there the rom file only has the game name and nothing else, ie: Super Mario World.zip and not Super Mario World (JP).zip. If you want to use this set you need to remove all the extra info from the rom filename.* You can rename your collection in Bulk using [this app for Windows](https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/#mainscreen) or using Automator in a Mac.
